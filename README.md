# open-rarity
We’re excited to announce OpenRarity v0.1 (Beta), a new rarity protocol we’re building for the NFT community. Our objective is to provide a transparent rarity calculation that is entirely open-source, objective, and reproducible.

With the explosion of new collections, marketplaces and tooling in the NFT ecosystem, we realized that rarity ranks often differed across platforms which could lead to confusion for buyers, sellers and creators. We believe it’s important to find a way to provide a unified and consistent set of rarity rankings across all platforms to help build more trust and transparency in the industry.

We are releasing the OpenRarity library in a Beta preview to crowdsource feedback from the community and incorporate it into the library evolution.
